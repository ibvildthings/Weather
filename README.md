# Weather App

I've used the Weather Underground API to build a Weather App to complete this app.
Because this was not a UI design challenge, I did not spend too much time on UI design.


1. I have implemented a single page application that fetches and displays the current weather conditions for user’s location.
2. The app fetches 10 day forecast data for user’s current location and display as a list.
3. Tapping on one of the days in the 10 day forecast list, shows you a detail screen for that day.

While building this app I used Codable to decode the JSON data. The second screen where you can see the 10 day weather forecast was a bit tricky to decode.
